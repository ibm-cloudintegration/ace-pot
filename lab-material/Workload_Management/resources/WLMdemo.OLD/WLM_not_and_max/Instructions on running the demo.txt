This demo has to be run using the default configuration broker and queue manager to work correctly.
1, Import the project provided in the WLM_not_max_pi.zip file.
2, Create the Queues WLM.IN1, WLM.IN2, WLM.OUT1 and WLM.OUT2 (file wlm.mqsc has the definitions).
3, Deploy the flow int the project to an execution group.
4, Start the following three applications:
  -  run_wlm_prod.bat - produces work load on queue WLM.IN1
  -  run_wlm_con.bat  - consumes work load from queue WLM.OUT1
  -  run_wlm_list.bat - subscribes to a topic to listen for notification alerts (put in # to subscribe for all flows)
These commands require a 64 jvm to run correctly.
5, You can then add policies etc to control the flow rate and cause notifications to happen.
