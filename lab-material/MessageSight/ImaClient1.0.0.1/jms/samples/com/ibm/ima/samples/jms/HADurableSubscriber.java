/**
 * Standalone topic subscriber sample for high availability
 * 
 * This application is intended for use with HATopicPublisher.  Both applications
 * demonstrate how IBM MessageSight JMS client applications can detect that a connection
 * to the server has been lost and can reconnect to the server in order to continue.
 * 
 * To fail over to a backup server when the connection to the primary is lost, the client application must 
 * recreate all of the JMS objects required for the subscription.
 * 
 * There are four positional arguments required to run this application and one optional argument:
 * 1. Server list - the list of server host names or IP addresses where IBM MessageSight is running in a high availability configuration
 * 2. Server port - the connection port for the IBM MessageSight server
 * 3. Topic name - the name of the topic from which messages will be received
 *                 NOTE: This topic name must match the name used for the HATopicPublisher sample
 * 4. Message count - the number of messages to receive
 * 5. Optional receivetimeout - the number of seconds to wait to receive the first message from the server.  The default is 10 seconds.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT NOTE:  This sample does not remove the durable subscription so that messages sent by HATopicPublisher 
 * while HADurableSubscriber is is not active will be received when HADurableSubscriber becomes active.  If you prefer
 * to remove the durable topic before this program exits, uncomment the lines in the main program that close the 
 * consumer and unsubscribe the session.
 * 
 * Example command line for the program:
 *      java com.ibm.ima.samples.jms.HADurableSubscriber "server1.mycompany.com, server2.mycompany.com" 16102 durableTopic 2000
 *      java com.ibm.ima.samples.jms.HADurableSubscriber "server1.mycompany.com, server2.mycompany.com" 16102 durableTopic 2000 60
 * 
 * To see the usage statement for the program, run it with no arguments:
 *      java com.ibm.ima.samples.jms.HADurableSubscriber
 *
