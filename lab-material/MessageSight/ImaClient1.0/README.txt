IBM MESSAGESIGHT JMS CLIENT CONTENT
===================================
The ImaJmsClientV1.0.zip package provides the IBM MessageSight client 
implementation of the Java™ Messaging Service (JMS).  It also provides 
documentation for the classes used to create and configure JMS administered 
objects for use with IBM MessageSight.  Finally, it includes Source Components 
and Sample Materials.

Directories and files:

                    demonstrating how to create administered objects, how to
                    send and receive messages via IBM MessageSight and how to 
                    write client applications that are enabled for high 
                    availability configurations

                fscontext.jar and providerutil.jar - JAR files which implement 
                    a file system JNDI provider
            
            license/ - contains the IBM MessageSight JMS Client license agreement files
 
                   
WORKING WITH SAMPLE APPLICATIONS
================================
There are four sample applications provided with the client.  They are:
    JMSSampleAdmin
    JMSSample
    HATopicPublisher
    HADurableSubscriber

The JMSSampleAdmin application demonstrates how to create, configure and store 
JMS administered objects for IBM MessageSight. It reads IBM 
MessageSight JMS administered object configurations from an input
file and populates a JNDI repository. This application can populate either LDAP
or file system JNDI repositories.  

The JMSSample application demonstrates how to send messages to and receive 
messages from IBM MessageSight topics and queues. It is implemented
in three classes, JMSSample, JMSSampleSend and JMSSampleReceive. The 
JMSSample application can either retrieve administered objects from a JNDI 
repository or it can create and configure the required administered objects at 
runtime.

HATopicPublisher and HADurableSubscriber demonstrate how to enable JMS client
applications to leverage IBM MessageSight high availability features.

To run the sample applications provided with the client, three JAR files are 
required in the class path; imaclientjms.jar, jms.jar, and jmssamples.jar.  All 
three files are located in ImaClient/jms/lib. In order to use the file system 
JNDI provider when running the JMSSampleAdmin and JMSSsample applications, two 
additional JAR files are required in the class path; fscontext.jar
and providerutil.jar. Both of these JAR files are also available in 
ImaClient/jms/lib.

Running the compiled samples on Linux:
======================================
Set the CLASSPATH environment variable as follows (running from ImaClient/jms)
on Linux:
    lib/imaclientjms.jar:lib/jms.jar:lib/jmssamples.jar
    
Or, if you want to use the file system JNDI provider, set CLASSPATH to:
    lib/imaclientjms.jar:lib/jms.jar:lib/jmssamples.jar:lib/fscontext.jar:lib/providerutil.jar

The following example command lines will run each application and will provide a
usage statement for each (running from ImaClient/jms).

    java -classpath $CLASSPATH com.ibm.ima.samples.jms.JMSSampleAdmin
    java -classpath $CLASSPATH com.ibm.ima.samples.jms.JMSSample
    java -classpath $CLASSPATH com.ibm.ima.samples.jms.HATopicPublisher
    java -classpath $CLASSPATH com.ibm.ima.samples.jms.HADurableSubscriber

Running the compiled samples on Windows:
========================================
Set the CLASSPATH environment variable as follows (running from ImaClient/jms)
on Windows:
    lib\imaclientjms.jar;lib\jms.jar;lib\jmssamples.jar
    
Or, if you want to use the file system JNDI provider, set CLASSPATH to:
    lib\imaclientjms.jar;lib\jms.jar;lib\jmssamples.jar;lib\fscontext.jar;lib\providerutil.jar

The following example command lines will run each application and will provide a
usage statement for each (running from ImaClient/jms).

    java -classpath %CLASSPATH% com.ibm.ima.samples.jms.JMSSampleAdmin
    java -classpath %CLASSPATH% com.ibm.ima.samples.jms.JMSSample
    java -classpath %CLASSPATH% com.ibm.ima.samples.jms.HATopicPublisher
    java -classpath %CLASSPATH% com.ibm.ima.samples.jms.HADurableSubscriber
    
To build the sample applications locally, only jms.jar and imaclientjms.jar are 
required in the build class path.


IMPORTING THE JMS CLIENT INTO ECLIPSE
=====================================
To import the IBM MessageSight JMS client into Eclipse, follow
these steps:
1. Unzip the contents of ImaJmsClientV1.0.zip 
2. In Eclipse, select File->General->Existing Projects into Workspace
3. Navigate to and select the jms subdirectory in the unpacked zip file content
4. Click the Finish button

Once you do this, you can compile and run the sample applications and your own 
client applications from Eclipse.


LIMITATIONS AND KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============================
1. The IBM MessageSight JMS Client implements only JSE JMS functionality. 
Optional methods and interfaces related to application server (JEE) support 
are not implemented.

2. The IBM MessageSight JMS implementation delivers messages in the order 
received.  Message priority settings have no affect on delivery order.
